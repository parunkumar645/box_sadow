Box Shadow Generator
Welcome to the Box Shadow Generator project! This beginner-friendly front-end development project allows you to create and customize box shadows using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Overview
Step 1: HTML Structure
In the first step, we use HTML to create the essential structure for our Box Shadow Generator. This includes necessary attributes and elements to lay the foundation for the project.

Step 2: CSS Styling
Next, we apply Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) to design and style the project. This step involves setting up padding and alignment to ensure the Box Shadow Generator is visually appealing and well-organized.

Step 3: JavaScript Functionality
In the final step, JavaScript is utilized to add logic and functionality to the Box Shadow Generator. We've named functions appropriately for clarity and added conditions to make the project user-friendly.
